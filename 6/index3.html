        The JavaScript FormData interface gives us a way to create an object of key-value pairs representing form fields 
        and their values.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        It uses the same format a form would use if the encoding type were set to <code>“multipart/form-data"</code>. This makes 
        it easy to format form data before sending it along with a fetch or XMLHTTPRequest.
    </p>

    <h2 align="left">What is the FormData object?</h2>
    <p align="left">
        In order to fully understand the FormData object, we need to know what it is. The FormData interface is 
        a native browser interface supported in all major browsers. This interface was created in order to allow 
        developers easier access to the content of form fields and their values. This helps prepare the content for 
        submission to an API or helps perform validation on said fields.
    </p>

    <h2 align="left">How to create a FormData Object?</h2>
    <p align="left">
        A FormData object can be created with the FormData constructor.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 align="left">How to access the data in a FormData object?</h2>
    <p align="left"> 
        The FormData object allows us to retrieve values directly through the get() method. You can 
        also append or delete values through the respective methods. You can also set a new value for a key with the 
        set() method. Finally, you can also loop through the key-value pairs either through looping over the 
        formDate.entries() or by using a for…of loop.
    </p>

    <h2 align="left">How to create URL query params based on the FormData?</h2>
    <p align="left"> 
        If you want to convert the FormData into a set of query params this is very simple to do. You can pass the FormData 
        object directly into the URLSearchParams.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 align="left">How to Post FormData With The Fetch API</h2>
    <p align="left"> 
        A FormData object can easily be used with the Fetch API. You can simply pass the object as the body of the request.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 align="left">How to Use The FormData Event</h2>
    <p align="left"> 
        Whenever a FormData object is created for a form, an event is dispatched against the form. We can listen to this event 
        and bind some logic to it, for example submitting the FormData to an API endpoint. In the example below we create a FormData
         object when the form is submitted. We listen to the FormData event and submit the data. This gives us the freedom to act 
         upon the creation of the FormData which might not only be on submit.
