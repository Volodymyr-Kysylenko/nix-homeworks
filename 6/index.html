        3 Reasons Why TypeScript is Better Than Vanilla JavaScript

        JBefore I used TypeScript on actual projects I used to think it was a waste of time. I thought it would cost a 
        lot of effort to document a type on every variable and function and make custom types and interfaces and more for 
        marginal benefits to my code.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Little did I know that I would come to fall in love with TypeScript.
    </p>
    <h2 align="justify">1. Compile-Time Errors</h2>
    <p align="justify">
        Unlike Vanilla JavaScript TypeScript is able to provide errors at compile time. Whether you are performing a
        wrong type check, passed in the wrong variable type to a function, or simply missed a required argument to a
        function TypeScript will let you know at compile time. This helps avoid unnecessary bugs and keeps your focus on
        improving your application.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2 align="justify">2. JavaScript is Valid TypeScript</h2>
    <p align="justify">
        TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles down to vanilla JavaScript. This means that you
        can paste any JavaScript file and change the file extension to “.ts” and it will be valid TypeScript out of the
        box. When you do not set a type, and TypeScript can’t infer the type from the context it will get the `any` type.
        If you want you can set stricter rules through a .tsconfig file, these rules help you enforce clean code and
        best practices. But when starting out with TypeScript or introducing TypeScript into a large codebase you
        might  want to start off with not too many strict rules and gradually set more rules. This makes the barrier to switching to TypeScript very low and allows you to use only the features of TypeScript you actually want/need.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2 align="justify">3. You Don’t Have to ‘Type’ Everything</h2>
    <p align="justify">
        TypeScript infers types to the best of its ability. You only have to manually document a type when it’s not
        clear what the type of the variable is going to be. When you do not set a type, and TypeScript can’t infer
        the type from the context it will get the any type. This type allows any form of content and can not be type checked. Although this is a bad practice it makes
        switching to TypeScript easier. This means you can convert your JavaScript code and worry about any types
        later. When we made the switch to TypeScript at my current position we spend several months converting a large
        codebase to TypeScript in small parts. The last step in this was disallowing the any type since this is often the
        most difficult step of the process.
