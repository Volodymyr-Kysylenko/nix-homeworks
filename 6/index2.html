        JavaScript utility functions are useful, reusable snippets that you can reuse across many different
        projects. Their purpose is to provide a consistent and efficient answer to common tasks and help improve the
        consistency of your code.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        In this article, I want to highlight 3 utility functions that I use in many of my projects and explain their
        uses.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2 align="center">1. Debounce</h2>
    <p align="center">
        In JavaScript, a debounce function will make sure your function will only be triggered once per user input
        or at least not more than once in the time period specified in the wait parameter. For example, let’s
        imagine that we want to show suggestions to the user based on a search query, we could
        show a suggestion while the user is typing and refresh after each letter that is typed, but this can be
        annoying for the user. It’s common to wait for example at least 300ms after a key is entered to display
        suggestions to make sure the user is done typing.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2 align="center">2. Convert a Number to a Currency</h2>
    <p align="center">
        When working with currencies in JavaScript things can get complex. Especially when you need to deal with
        displaying different types of currencies. JavaScript offers the Intl.NumberFormat object which allows you
        to format numbers in a language-sensitive manner. One of the options it offers is to format the number as a
        currency.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2 align="center">3. Convert an HTML String to a DOM Object</h2>
    <p align="center"> 
        There are many cases in which you might receive an HTML string instead of an HTML element. For example, when 
        receiving HTML in a JSON response from an API or when rendering a template through a template parser like Nunjucks. 
        You can inject this HTML string directly into the dom through the innerHTML property, but sometimes you want to convert 
        this string to an HTML object for additional transformations, validations, or more specific DOM injecting.
